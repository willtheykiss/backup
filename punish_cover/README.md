## Lyrics

```
Whatever's wrong with me
I will take to bed
I give in so easy
Nature chews on me

Little death like lead
Poisonous and heavy
It has always been this way
Mm, it has always been this way

I am punished by love
I am punished by love

In the morning I will mar myself again
He was a natural Plauch√©, saying "You won't forget this"
Shame is sharp, and my skin gives so easy
Only God knows, only God would believe
That I was an angel, but they made me leave

I am punished by love
I am punished by love
I am punished by love
I am punished by love
```
